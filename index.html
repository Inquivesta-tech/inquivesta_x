                    science college festivals in India. It was created in 2011 with the aim of promoting science in an
                    entertaining and engaging manner to a wider audience. Since then, Inquivesta has successfully
                    organized nine editions under the tagline "Being Inquisitive". These editions have included a
                    variety of events that showcase science, technology, and innovation, as well as workshops, guest
                    lectures, celebrity appearances, and engaging competitions in fine arts, sports, and adventure.
                    Inquivesta attracts a diverse audience ranging from school and college students to working
                    professionals.
